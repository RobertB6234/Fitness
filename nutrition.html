		<h2>Food for Thought</h2>
		<img src="images/nutrition1.jpg" alt="food for thought image" class="desktop">
		<p>Good nutrition is a lifestyle, not a diet. It starts with a new way of thinking about food. Think of your body as a vehicle that uses food for fuel. Fill your tank with the right type of fuel.</p>
		<p>Do not approach your nutrition plan as a diet plan, 	but rather, a lifestyle change. If you make a permanent change, you will see big results. The key to success is a daily focus on your goal.</p> 
		<p>Portion your meals and track your calories. There are many free mobile apps available to help track your activity level and calories.</p>
		<p>Control impulsive urges to buy junk food, and 	instead, allow yourself to one "cheat" meal a week.</p>

		<h2>What to eat?</h2>
		<img src="images/nutrition2.jpg" alt="food image" class="desktop">
		<p>Use the following as a guideline:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Protein, such as eggs, chicken, and lean red meat</li>
			<li>Vegetables, but avoid corn and peas</li>
			<li>Fruit</li>
			<li>Fat, such as olive oil, nuts, and seeds</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Limit the consumption of bread, pasta, white potatoes, and processed food. These foods are high in carbohydrates.</p>
		<p>When you shop for groceries, shop the outside aisles and buy organic when possible. Stock up on fresh vegetables, almond flour, and flax seed.</p>
